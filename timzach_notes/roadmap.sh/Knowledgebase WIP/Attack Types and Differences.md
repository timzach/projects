## Whishing

Whishing, a portmanteau of "wireless" and "phishing," is a cyber attack method that targets users of wireless networks, particularly public Wi-Fi hotspots. Attackers set up rogue wireless access points or compromise existing ones to intercept network traffic or redirect users to malicious websites. These fake hotspots often mimic legitimate ones, tricking users into connecting and potentially exposing their sensitive information. Whishing attacks can lead to theft of login credentials, financial data, or personal information. To protect against whishing, users are advised to avoid sensitive transactions on public Wi-Fi, use VPNs, verify network authenticity, and ensure HTTPS connections when browsing.

## Whaling

Whaling is a specific type of phishing attack that targets high-profile individuals within an organization, such as executives, CEOs, or other senior leaders. The term "whaling" is derived from the idea of hunting large "whales," as opposed to the more common "phishing," which targets a broader range of users. Whaling attacks are highly sophisticated and often involve personalized emails or communications that appear legitimate, making them difficult to detect.

## Smishing

Smishing, a portmanteau of "SMS" and "phishing," is a form of cyber attack that uses text messages (SMS) to deceive recipients into divulging sensitive information or taking harmful actions. Attackers typically impersonate trusted entities like banks, government agencies, or popular services, urging victims to click on malicious links, download harmful apps, or provide personal data. These messages often create a sense of urgency or offer enticing rewards to manipulate recipients. Smishing exploits the trust people place in mobile communications and the limited security features of SMS. As mobile device usage increases, smishing has become a significant threat, requiring user awareness and caution when interacting with unsolicited text messages.

## Spam vs. Spim

Spam refers to unsolicited and often irrelevant messages sent over email, typically to a large number of recipients, with the purpose of advertising, phishing, spreading malware, or other malicious activities. Spam emails are usually sent by automated bots and are characterized by their bulk nature. Spim is a type of spam that specifically targets instant messaging (IM) platforms rather than email. Spim messages are unsolicited and typically used for advertising, phishing, or spreading malware. As instant messaging apps have grown in popularity, so too has the prevalence of Spim.

## Shoulder Surfing

In a Shoulder Surfing Attack, an attacker tries to get information when you are unaware of where the attacker looks over your shoulder or from your back to see what you're doing on your device and obtain sensitive information. Shoulder Surfing attacks are accomplished by observing the content "over the victim's shoulder". It is a social engineering attack where the attackers physically view the device screen and keypad to obtain personal information. This attack is mostly done when you are in a public place or crowded area. Sometimes attackers attack when you are busy on your device and the attacker could be your friend, someone you know or it may be some stranger.

## Tailgating

Tailgating is the act of getting access to a restricted area by simply following an authorized person. This is a common social engineering technique used by attackers to gain physical access to a building or a restricted area. The attacker waits for an authorized person to open the door and then follows them inside. This technique is effective because it is based on trust and the assumption that the attacker is an authorized person.

## Dumpster Diving

Dumpster Diving in the context of cybersecurity refers to the practice of searching through discarded materials in trash or recycling bins to find confidential information. This technique may seem unsophisticated, but it can be extremely effective in obtaining valuable data such as passwords, account information, network diagrams, or any other sensitive information that has not been properly destroyed.

## Zero Day

A zero-day vulnerability is a software security flaw unknown to the vendor and exploit developers, leaving it unpatched and potentially exploitable. When attackers discover and exploit such a vulnerability before the software creator can develop and release a fix, it's called a zero-day attack. These attacks are particularly dangerous because they take advantage of the window between discovery and patching, during which systems are highly vulnerable. Zero-days are prized in cybercriminal circles and can be used for various malicious purposes, including data theft, system compromise, or as part of larger attack campaigns. Defending against zero-days often requires proactive security measures, as traditional signature-based defenses are ineffective against unknown threats.

## Social Engineering

Social Engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human psychology to gain access to confidential information, systems, or physical locations. Unlike traditional hacking methods that rely on technical skills, social engineering primarily focuses on deceiving or tricking individuals into revealing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security.

## Reconnaissance

Reconnaissance is the first phase of a cyberattack, during which attackers gather as much information as possible about a target system, network, or organization. The goal of reconnaissance is to identify potential vulnerabilities, entry points, and other valuable details that can be exploited in subsequent attack phases.

## Impersonation

Impersonation in cybersecurity refers to an attack technique where a threat actor pretends to be a legitimate person or entity to deceive individuals, systems, or organizations. This tactic is commonly used in social engineering attacks to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, resources, or systems.

## Watering Hole Attack

Watering Hole Attack is a type of cyberattack where the attacker targets a specific group of users by compromising a website or online resource that they are known to frequently visit. The name "watering hole" comes from the idea of predators waiting by a water source to attack prey, similar to how attackers wait for their targets to visit a compromised site.

## Drive-by Attack

Drive-by Attack is a type of cyberattack where malicious code is automatically downloaded and executed on a user's system simply by visiting a compromised or malicious website. The user does not need to click on anything or interact with the page; just loading the website is enough to trigger the attack.

## Typosquatting

Typosquatting is a form of cyberattack that exploits common typing errors made by users when entering website URLs into their browsers. Attackers create malicious websites with URLs that are very similar to legitimate ones, often differing by just a single letter, number, or symbol. When a user accidentally mistypes a URL, they may be redirected to the malicious site, where they can be subjected to phishing attacks, malware downloads, or other forms of cyber exploitation.

## Brute Force vs Password Spray

### What is Brute Force?

Brute Force is a method of password cracking where an attacker systematically tries all possible combinations of characters until the correct password is found. This method is highly resource-intensive, as it involves attempting numerous password variations in a relatively short period of time.

### What is Password Spray?

Password Spray is a more targeted and stealthy method of password cracking where an attacker tries a small number of common passwords across many different accounts. Instead of bombarding a single account with numerous password attempts (as in brute force), password spraying involves using one or a few passwords against multiple accounts.
