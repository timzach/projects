# Roles of Compliance and Auditors

Compliance officers ensure that an organization adheres to legal, regulatory, and internal policies by proactively implementing controls, training employees, and mitigating risks. Auditors, both internal and external, assess the effectiveness of these controls and the accuracy of financial reporting through periodic evaluations, providing independent assurance to management and stakeholders. While compliance focuses on prevention and day-to-day adherence, auditors focus on verifying and evaluating past performance to ensure integrity and identify areas for improvement. Both roles work together to manage risk and maintain organizational accountability.
