# Zero Day

A zero-day vulnerability is a software security flaw unknown to the vendor and exploit developers, leaving it unpatched and potentially exploitable. When attackers discover and exploit such a vulnerability before the software creator can develop and release a fix, it's called a zero-day attack. These attacks are particularly dangerous because they take advantage of the window between discovery and patching, during which systems are highly vulnerable. Zero-days are prized in cybercriminal circles and can be used for various malicious purposes, including data theft, system compromise, or as part of larger attack campaigns. Defending against zero-days often requires proactive security measures, as traditional signature-based defenses are ineffective against unknown threats.

# Known vs Unknown

"known" and "unknown" refer to the classification of threats based on the visibility and familiarity of the attack or vulnerability.

- **Known Threats** are those that have been previously identified and documented, such as malware signatures, vulnerabilities, or attack patterns. Security solutions like antivirus software and intrusion detection systems typically rely on databases of known threats to recognize and block them. These threats are easier to defend against because security teams have the tools and knowledge to detect and mitigate them.

- **Unknown Threats**, on the other hand, refer to new, emerging, or sophisticated threats that have not been previously encountered or documented. These can include zero-day vulnerabilities, which are software flaws not yet known to the vendor or the public, or advanced malware designed to evade traditional defenses. Unknown threats require more advanced detection techniques, such as behavioral analysis, machine learning, or heuristic-based detection, to identify anomalies and suspicious activities that don't match known patterns.

# APT

Advanced Persistent Threats, or APTs, are a class of cyber threats characterized by their persistence over a long period, extensive resources, and high level of sophistication. Often associated with nation-state actors, organized cybercrime groups, and well-funded hackers, APTs are primarily focused on targeting high-value assets, such as critical infrastructure, financial systems, and government agencies.
