# Penetration Testing Rules of Engagement

**Penetration Testing Rules of Engagement** define the guidelines and boundaries for conducting a penetration test. They establish the scope, objectives, and constraints, including the systems and networks to be tested, the testing methods allowed, and the times during which testing can occur. These rules ensure that the testing is conducted ethically and legally, minimizing disruptions and protecting sensitive data. They also include communication protocols for reporting findings and any necessary approvals or permissions from stakeholders to ensure that the testing aligns with organizational policies and compliance requirements.
