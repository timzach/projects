# VirusTotal

VirusTotal's main feature is multi-scanning using over 70 antivirus scanners to generate a cumulative report on whether a file is malicious. It also stores file hashes, eliminating the need to rescan previously uploaded files. Researchers can comment in the community, sharing their analysis and insights into malware for others to benefit from. VirusTotal's aggregated data comes from various antivirus engines, website scanners, file and URL analysis tools, and user contributions. These tools serve diverse purposes, including heuristic engines, known-bad signatures, metadata extraction, and identification of malicious signals. Additionally, VirusTotal offers services to search by file hash, IP address, and URL, which are also scanned. For more comprehensive features, VirusTotal provides Premium services such as Intelligence & Hunting.

# Whois

WHOIS is a query and response protocol used to retrieve information about registered domain names, IP addresses, and autonomous systems on the Internet. It provides details such as the domain registrar, registration date, expiration date, and contact information for the domain owner (although this may be limited due to privacy protection). WHOIS databases are maintained by regional Internet registries and domain registrars. The protocol is commonly used by network administrators, cybersecurity professionals, and researchers for tasks like verifying domain ownership, investigating potential cyber threats, and gathering information for legal or business purposes. However, with the implementation of GDPR and other privacy regulations, some WHOIS information has become more restricted.
