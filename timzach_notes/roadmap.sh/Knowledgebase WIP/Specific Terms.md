# Firewalls & Next-Generation Firewalls

Firewalls are network security devices that monitor and control incoming and outgoing traffic based on predetermined security rules. Traditional firewalls operate at the network layer, filtering traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols. They provide basic protection by creating a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks.

Next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) build upon this foundation, offering more advanced features to address modern cyber threats. NGFWs incorporate deep packet inspection, application-level filtering, and integrated intrusion prevention systems. They can identify and control applications regardless of port or protocol, enabling more granular security policies. NGFWs often include additional security functions such as SSL/TLS inspection, antivirus scanning, and threat intelligence integration. This evolution allows for more comprehensive network protection, better visibility into network traffic, and improved defense against sophisticated attacks in today's complex and dynamic threat landscape.

# Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is a security solution designed to monitor and analyze network traffic for signs of suspicious activity or potential threats. NIDS operates by inspecting the data packets that flow through a network, looking for patterns that match known attack signatures or anomalies that could indicate malicious behavior. Unlike a Host Intrusion Detection System (HIDS), which focuses on individual host devices, NIDS provides a broader view by monitoring network traffic across multiple systems and devices.

# NIPS

A **Network Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS)** is a security technology designed to monitor, detect, and prevent malicious activities or policy violations on a network. Unlike intrusion detection systems (IDS), which only alert on potential threats, a NIPS actively blocks or mitigates suspicious traffic in real-time. It analyzes network traffic patterns, inspects packet contents, and uses predefined signatures or behavioral analysis to identify threats. By preventing attacks such as malware, unauthorized access, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, a NIPS helps protect network integrity and maintain secure operations.

# Host-based Firewall

A host-based firewall is a software application that runs directly on individual devices, such as computers, servers, or mobile devices, to control network traffic to and from that specific host. It acts as a security barrier, monitoring and filtering incoming and outgoing network connections based on predefined rules. Host-based firewalls provide an additional layer of protection beyond network firewalls, allowing for more granular control over each device's network activities. They can block unauthorized access attempts, prevent malware from communicating with command and control servers, and restrict applications from making unexpected network connections. This approach is particularly valuable in environments with mobile or remote workers, where devices may not always be protected by corporate network firewalls. However, managing host-based firewalls across numerous devices can be challenging, requiring careful policy configuration and regular updates to maintain effective security without impeding legitimate user activities.

# Sandboxing

Sandboxing is a security technique where a program or code is isolated in a controlled environment, or "sandbox," to prevent it from affecting other parts of the system. This isolation allows suspicious or untrusted code, such as software, scripts, or files, to be executed and analyzed safely without risking harm to the host system. Sandboxing is commonly used to detect malware or test potentially harmful applications in cybersecurity.

# Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) vs Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP)

EAP and PEAP are both authentication frameworks used in wireless networks and Point-to-Point connections to provide secure access. EAP is a flexible authentication framework that supports multiple authentication methods, such as token cards, certificates, and passwords, allowing for diverse implementations in network security. However, EAP by itself does not provide encryption, leaving the authentication process potentially vulnerable to attacks.

PEAP, on the other hand, is a version of EAP designed to enhance security by encapsulating the EAP communication within a secure TLS (Transport Layer Security) tunnel. This tunnel protects the authentication process from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. PEAP requires a server-side certificate to establish the TLS tunnel, but it does not require client-side certificates, making it easier to deploy while still ensuring secure transmission of credentials. PEAP is widely used in wireless networks to provide a secure authentication mechanism that protects user credentials during the authentication process.

# WPS

Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) is a network security standard designed to make it easier to connect devices to a secure wireless network. It allows users to add devices to a Wi-Fi network using a simple setup process, typically involving pressing a WPS button on the router and the device or entering a PIN. While WPS simplifies the connection process, it has known security vulnerabilities, which can potentially be exploited to gain unauthorized access to the network.

# ACL

An Access Control List (ACL) is a security mechanism used to define which users or system processes are granted access to objects, such as files, directories, or network resources, and what operations they can perform on those objects. ACLs function by maintaining a list of permissions attached to each object, specifying the access rights of various entities—like users, groups, or network traffic—thereby providing fine-grained control over who can read, write, execute, or modify the resources. This method is essential in enforcing security policies, reducing unauthorized access, and ensuring that only legitimate users can interact with sensitive data or systems.

# WPA vs WPA2 vs WPA3 vs WEP

WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) is an outdated and insecure wireless encryption standard that was the first to secure Wi-Fi networks but is now considered highly vulnerable to attacks. WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) improved upon WEP with stronger encryption and authentication methods, but it still had some security weaknesses. WPA2, the successor to WPA, introduced more robust encryption with the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and improved security overall. WPA3, the latest standard, offers enhanced security features such as stronger encryption, improved protection against brute-force attacks, and better security for public networks. Each successive standard provides increased security and protection for wireless networks.
