# LOLBAS

**LOLBAS** (Living Off the Land Binaries and Scripts) refers to a collection of legitimate system binaries and scripts that can be abused by attackers to perform malicious actions while evading detection. These tools, which are often part of the operating system or installed software, can be leveraged for various purposes, such as executing commands, accessing data, or modifying system configurations, thereby allowing attackers to carry out their activities without deploying custom malware. The use of LOLBAS techniques makes it harder for traditional security solutions to detect and prevent malicious activities since the binaries and scripts used are typically trusted and deemed legitimate.

# GTFOBINS

GTFOBins (GTFOBINS) is a curated list of Unix binaries that can be exploited by attackers to bypass local security restrictions on a misconfigured system. It provides a detailed index of commands and scripts, demonstrating how certain binaries, when used improperly, can enable privilege escalation, file manipulation, and other unauthorized activities, thus serving as a resource for both security professionals to understand potential vulnerabilities and for attackers to identify and exploit weaknesses.

# WADCOMS

WADcoms (Web Application Dangerous Commands) is a comprehensive database of dangerous web application commands and patterns that can be exploited to compromise web security. It offers a catalog of potentially harmful commands and their contexts, helping security professionals identify and mitigate risks associated with web applications by understanding how these commands can be misused for attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and remote code execution (RCE).
