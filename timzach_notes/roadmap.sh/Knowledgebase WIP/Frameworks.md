# Diamond Model

The Diamond Model is a cybersecurity framework used for analyzing and understanding cyber threats by breaking down an attack into four core components: Adversary, Infrastructure, Capability, and Victim. The Adversary represents the entity behind the attack, the Infrastructure refers to the systems and resources used by the attacker (such as command and control servers), the Capability denotes the tools or malware employed, and the Victim is the target of the attack. The model emphasizes the relationships between these components, helping analysts to identify patterns, track adversary behavior, and understand the broader context of cyber threats. By visualizing and connecting these elements, the Diamond Model aids in developing more effective detection, mitigation, and response strategies.

# Cyber Kill Chain

The **Cyber Kill Chain** is a model that was developed by Lockheed Martin, a major aerospace, military support, and security company, to understand and prevent cyber intrusions in various networks and systems. It serves as a framework for breaking down the stages of a cyber attack, making it easier for security professionals to identify, mitigate, and prevent threats.

The concept is based on a military model, where the term "kill chain" represents a series of steps needed to successfully target and engage an adversary. In the context of cybersecurity, the model breaks down the stages of a cyber attack into seven distinct phases:

- **Reconnaissance**: This initial phase involves gathering intelligence on the target, which may include researching public databases, performing network scans, or social engineering techniques.
- **Weaponization**: In this stage, the attacker creates a weapon – such as a malware, virus, or exploit – and packages it with a delivery mechanism that can infiltrate the target's system.
- **Delivery**: The attacker selects and deploys the delivery method to transmit the weapon to the target. Common methods include email attachments, malicious URLs, or infected software updates.
- **Exploitation**: This is the phase where the weapon is activated, taking advantage of vulnerabilities in the target's systems or applications to execute the attacker's code.
- **Installation**: Once the exploit is successful, the attacker installs the malware on the victim's system, setting the stage for further attacks or data exfiltration.
- **Command and Control (C2)**: The attacker establishes a communication channel with the infected system, allowing them to remotely control the malware and conduct further actions.
- **Actions on Objectives**: In this final phase, the attacker achieves their goal, which may involve stealing sensitive data, compromising systems, or disrupting services.

# ATT&CK

MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. It provides a comprehensive matrix of attack methods used by threat actors, organized into tactics like initial access, execution, persistence, and exfiltration. This framework is widely used by cybersecurity professionals for threat modeling, improving defensive capabilities, and developing more effective security strategies. ATT&CK helps organizations understand attacker behavior, assess their security posture, and prioritize defenses against the most relevant threats.
