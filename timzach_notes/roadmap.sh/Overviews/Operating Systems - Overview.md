# Operating Systems

**Operating systems (OS)** are software that manage computer hardware and provide a platform for applications to run. They handle essential functions such as managing memory, processing tasks, controlling input and output devices, and facilitating file management. Key examples include **[[Windows]]**, **[[MacOS]]**, **[[Linux]]**, and **Unix**. Each operating system offers different features and interfaces, tailored to specific user needs or system requirements, from desktop computing to server management and embedded systems.
