# Common Virtualization Technologies
## VMWare

VMware is a leading provider of virtualization and cloud computing software. Its core technology allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical server, each with its own operating system and resources. VMware's product suite includes tools for server virtualization, desktop virtualization, cloud management, and network virtualization. Key products like vSphere and ESXi enable efficient resource utilization, improved scalability, and simplified IT management. VMware's solutions are widely used in enterprise environments for consolidating servers, enabling cloud computing, facilitating disaster recovery, and supporting development and testing environments. The company's technology plays a crucial role in modern data center operations and hybrid cloud strategies.

## VirtualBox

VirtualBox is a free, open-source virtualization software developed by Oracle. It allows users to run multiple operating systems simultaneously on a single physical machine. VirtualBox supports a wide range of guest operating systems, including various versions of Windows, Linux, macOS, and more. It provides features like snapshots for easy system state preservation, shared folders for file exchange between host and guest systems, and USB device support. VirtualBox is popular among developers, IT professionals, and enthusiasts for testing software, running legacy applications, and experimenting with different operating systems without the need for separate physical hardware.

## esxi

VMware ESXi is a Type 1 hypervisor and the core building block for VMware's virtualization technology. It represents a bare-metal hypervisor, which means it is installed directly onto your physical server's hardware, without the need for a supporting operating system. This results in elevated performance, reduced overhead, and efficient resource allocation.

## proxmox

**Proxmox** is an open-source virtualization management platform that integrates both **Proxmox Virtual Environment (Proxmox VE)** and **Proxmox Mail Gateway**. Proxmox VE combines virtualization technologies, including KVM for virtual machines and LXC for lightweight containers, into a unified web-based interface for managing and deploying virtualized environments. It offers features such as high availability, storage management, and backup solutions. Proxmox Mail Gateway provides email security and anti-spam solutions, protecting email systems from threats. Proxmox is valued for its flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and comprehensive management capabilities.

# Basics of Virtualization

## Hypervisor

A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM), is software or firmware that enables the creation and management of virtual machines (VMs) by abstracting the underlying hardware. It allows multiple VMs to run on a single physical machine, each operating independently with its own operating system and applications. Hypervisors facilitate better resource utilization by allowing a physical server to host several virtual environments, optimizing hardware efficiency.

There are two types of hypervisors:
- **Type 1 hypervisor**, or bare-metal hypervisor, runs directly on the physical hardware without a host operating system. It provides better performance and is commonly used in enterprise environments. Examples include VMware ESXi and Microsoft Hyper-V.
- **Type 2 hypervisor** runs on top of an existing operating system, relying on the host OS for resource management. These are typically used for personal or development purposes, with examples like VMware Workstation and Oracle VirtualBox.

Hypervisors are fundamental in cloud computing, virtualization, and server consolidation, allowing for flexible and efficient resource management and isolation between virtual environments.

## GuestOS

A Guest Operating System (Guest OS) refers to an operating system that runs within a virtual machine (VM) environment, managed by a hypervisor or virtual machine monitor. In virtualization technology, the Guest OS operates as if it were running on dedicated physical hardware, but it's actually sharing resources with the host system and potentially other guest systems. This concept is crucial in cybersecurity for several reasons. It allows for isolation of systems, enabling secure testing environments for malware analysis or vulnerability assessments. Guest OSes can be quickly deployed, cloned, or reset, facilitating rapid incident response and recovery. However, they also introduce new security considerations, such as potential vulnerabilities in the hypervisor layer, escape attacks where malware breaks out of the VM, and resource contention issues. Properly configuring, patching, and monitoring Guest OSes is essential for maintaining a secure virtualized infrastructure, balancing the benefits of flexibility and isolation with the need for robust security measures.

## Host OS

A Host Operating System (Host OS) refers to the primary operating system installed directly on a computer's hardware, managing the physical resources and providing a platform for running applications and, in virtualized environments, supporting virtual machines. In cybersecurity, the Host OS plays a critical role as it forms the foundation of the system's security posture. It's responsible for implementing core security features such as access controls, system hardening, and patch management. The Host OS often runs the hypervisor software in virtualized environments, making its security crucial for protecting all guest operating systems and applications running on top of it. Vulnerabilities in the Host OS can potentially compromise all hosted virtual machines and services. Therefore, securing the Host OS through regular updates, proper configuration, and robust monitoring is essential for maintaining the overall security of both physical and virtualized IT infrastructures.

## VM

A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer. It runs an operating system and applications, isolated from the underlying hardware. VMs allow multiple "guest" operating systems to run on a single physical "host" machine, each with its own allocated virtual resources (CPU, memory, storage). This technology enables efficient hardware utilization, easier system administration, and improved security through isolation. VMs are widely used in cloud computing, software development, testing environments, and for running legacy applications. Hypervisors, such as VMware vSphere or Microsoft Hyper-V, manage the creation and operation of VMs on physical hardware.
