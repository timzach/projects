# SSL vs TLS

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are cryptographic protocols used to provide security in internet communications. These protocols encrypt the data that is transmitted over the web, so anyone who tries to intercept packets will not be able to interpret the data. One difference that is important to know is that SSL is now deprecated due to security flaws, and most modern web browsers no longer support it. But TLS is still secure and widely supported, so preferably use TLS.
