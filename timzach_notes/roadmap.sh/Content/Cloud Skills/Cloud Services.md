# SaaS

Software as a Service (SaaS) is a cloud-based model where software applications are delivered to users over the internet, eliminating the need for local installation or maintenance. SaaS providers manage infrastructure, security, and updates, allowing users to access the software on a subscription basis from any device with an internet connection. This model offers scalability, reduced upfront costs, and easy integration with other cloud services, making it a popular choice for businesses looking for flexibility and efficiency in software deployment.

# PaaS

Platform as a Service, or **PaaS**, is a type of cloud computing service that provides a platform for developers to create, deploy, and maintain software applications. PaaS combines the software development platform and the underlying infrastructure, such as servers, storage, and networking resources. This enables developers to focus on writing and managing their applications, without worrying about the underlying infrastructure's setup, maintenance, and scalability. PaaS simplifies the application development and deployment process by providing a platform and its associated tools, saving developers time and resources. By leveraging PaaS, organizations can focus on their core competencies and build innovative applications without worrying about infrastructure management.

# IaaS

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a type of cloud computing service that offers virtualized computing resources over the internet. Essentially, it enables you to rent IT infrastructure—such as virtual machines (VMs), storage, and networking—on a pay-as-you-go basis instead of buying and maintaining your own physical hardware.
